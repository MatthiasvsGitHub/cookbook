          <h1 class="card-title">OKRA SOUP</h1>
          <p class="card-text"> Just like ogbono soup and Ewedu soup, Okro soup has a viscous texture which makes it an acquired taste. Talking about Ogbono soup – this is a thick delicious, and hearty soup made from the Wild mango seeds, and it has a ton of nutritional benefits.

            The jute leaves soup (Jewish mallow) is leafy green which also has a similar mucilaginous texture like okro when cooked. It is not only common in Africa but it’s also known to be a national Egyptian dish. Some people find Okro soup, Ogbono soup or jute leaves soup viscous or slimy and I totally relate. It’s a matter of preference and how we all were socialized. This recipe uses onions. Yes, you read well. Onions in okra soup have always been an issue that is really debated. It is believed that onions make the soup less viscous. this can be true if a lot of onion is added, however, if a little is added as I did in this recipe, your okro soup will be nice, thick and viscous. If you are not comfortable using it, you can skip it. Okra soup is often classically made with beef (beef parts) and fish. However, shrimps, Lamb Meat, goat meat, or any other meat or fish of choice can be used.

            This variation in its mode of preparation has a lot to do with ethnicity and locality. For example, those who live close to the sea will tend to have more seafood in their okro soup.

          <li class="list-group-item"> <h2>METHOD</h2></li>
          <ol>
              <li>Start by creating a base stock for the okro soup by boiling the roast turkey or any other meat of choice with salt, seasoning cube and onions. Cook till tender.</li>
              <li>While the meat is boiling, mince half of the onions in a food processor or a chopper and slice the other half. Set aside</li>
              <li>Mince the red bell pepper and habanero pepper in the chopper and set aside</li>
              <li>Once the meat is tender, add the minced pepper, crayfish, and locust bean and leave to cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
              <li>Shred and add the washed dry fish and leave to soften for about 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>Add the palm oil and the shrimps and the minced and sliced okro. Leave to cook for about 3 to 5 minutes depending on how crunchy you want the okro to be.</li>
              <li>Stir in the spinach and mix until wilted.</li>
              <li>Take away from heat immediately and serve. </li>
              <li>This stew can be served with your choice of swallow like Eba, Fufu, Amala and the likes but for me, I just like to eat as is – yes I mean I just use a spoon to dig and eat the stew just the way it is.</li>

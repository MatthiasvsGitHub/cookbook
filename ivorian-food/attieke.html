                This Attieke or Cassava couscous with fried fish is just amazing! Attiéké (spelled acheke) is a popular side dish originated from Côte d’Ivoire in west coast of Africa. Attieke is made from fermented grated and granulated cassava. Now attieke dish is adopted throughout Africa and making its ways to the rest of the world.
The best thing is Attieke may be carb but it is gluten free which is good for me since i am sensitive to gluten. The perfect recipe for weekdays when you are tired. Of course it doesn’t take long to put together if you have the fried fish ready. It also can be eaten as is if you are vegan. Attieke goes with almost any meat no matter how the meat was cooked. Whether it is baked, grilled or fried meat. One of my favorite way of eating this is with sardines.<br><br>

                      Clean your fish of scales and fins unless you get it cleaned at the store.
                      Make two or three cuts along each side of the fish. Blend garlic, cilantro, and parsley and transfer to a bowl.
                      Add vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Maggi and mix.
                      Season and stuff the fish with the marinade.
                      Oil your pan and fry the fish until crispy on the outside.

                    <li>
                      Like I said in the ingredients, you can find attieke frozen or boxed. It’s fine to use whichever is available. If you’re using the frozen kind, you’re just going to heat it in your microwave until it starts to crumble, checking on it regularly. For the boxed attieke, the instructions are on the packaging. Usually, you measure the amount of attieke you want and add water then microwave it, also checking on it regularly. For reference, 1 cup of attieke = 1 cup of water.
                      On a plate, present the attiéké topped with salad, as an accompaniment to grilled fish.
